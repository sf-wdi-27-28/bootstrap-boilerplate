# Bootstrap Lab

For this lab, consult the [bootstrap docs](http://getbootstrap.com/) liberally. __HINT__: check out the solution branch to check your work `git checkout solution`

__Throughout this lesson (and your developer life!), watch your indentation!!__

Remember to commit and push frequently.

#### Getting Started
1. Fork this repo.
1. In terminal, clone your fork.
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bootstrap-boilerplate.git
```

#### Grid
**Lorem Ipsum**: for these challenges, use [lorem ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html) or the always entertaining [hipster ipsum](http://hipsum.co/) text to fill in your columns.

1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a grid that is 4 columns wide when on desktop (lg), 3 on laptop (md), 2 on tablet (sm), and 1 on mobile.

1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a grid that has one column, six units wide, with an offset of three on the left -- except for on mobile where the column is full width.

1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a three column grid that is 3-6-3 on desktop (lg), or 2-6-2 with 1 offset on tablet (sm). On mobile (xs), it should show as one column, and the leftmost column should be hidden.

#### Buttons
1. Add a button to your index. Look at the [button docs](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons) to see the different button styles and their associated bootstrap classes.

1. Add 3 more buttons. Add a custom class with custom css to at least 2 of the buttons. Play with `:hover`.

#### More!

Pick any website online, wireframe it on paper or whiteboard and create a simple bootstrap version with the bootstrap grid, buttons, navbar, lorem ipsum, and [Placehold.it](https://placehold.it/). A good place to find a site to copy is [Made with Bootstrap](http://builtwithbootstrap.com/). (**Hint**: Use bootstrap's [image classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images) to size images.)
