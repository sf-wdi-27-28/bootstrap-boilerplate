# Bootstrap Lab

1. Create a new folder from your terminal called "bootstrap" and create a new file in it called index.html. Paste into this file the bootstrap boilerplate.

1. Add the boilerplate navbar code above the `div` with the class `.container`.

  **Lorem Ipsum**: for the rest of these challenges, use [lorem ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html) text to fill in your columns.

1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a grid that is 4 columns wide when on desktop (lg), 3 on laptop (md), 2 on tablet (sm), and 1 on mobile.

1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a grid that has one column, six units wide, with an offset of three on the left -- except for on mobile where the column is full width.

1. Using the bootstrap grid, make a three column grid that is 3-6-3 on desktop (lg), or 2-6-2 with 1 offset on tablet (sm). On mobile (xs), it should show as one column, and the leftmost column should be hidden.

# Stretch

Pick any website online, wireframe it on paper or whiteboard and create a simple bootstrap version with the bootstrap grid, navbar, lorem ipsum, and [Placehold.it](https://placehold.it/). (**Hint**: Use bootstrap's [image classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images) to size images.)
